    <p>You can find Mr. Jorgenson <a href="http://twitter.com/noahj32">on Twitter</a> or send him <a
    href="mailto:&#110;&#111;&#097;&#104;&#064;&#105;&#097;&#109;&#110;&#111;&#097;&#104;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">an email</a>.</p>

    <p>Noah works at <a href="http://www.utulsa.edu">The University of Tulsa</a>. When he's not
    doing that, he's <a href="http://iamnoah.com">blogging</a>, hacking on
    <a href="https://github.com/magus">code</a>, and <a
    href="http://iamnoah.com/videos">filming videos</a> of 3D CGI he build with his
	bare mouse and keyboard. He would cease to function correctly without daily
	doses of anime and music.</p>

    <p>Noah has also been working on <a
    href="http://www.seat.utulsa.edu/serebro.php">SEREBRO</a> since 2007. It's
    amassed multiple publications over the past few years. SEREBRO has been featured
	at conferences such as the <a href="http://2011.icse-conferences.org/content/serebro-facilitating-student-project-team-collaboration">Internation Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)</a>
	and was funded by the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation.</a>

    <p>If you have any questions or feedback, check out the issues on <a
    href="https://github.com/magus/magus.github.com/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1">
    on GitHub.</a> It's sort of like an "Ask Me Anything" setup, except it uses a
    nerdy social network and crams it into a bug tracker.</p>
