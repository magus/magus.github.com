Hi. This is a [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)-powered blog hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) for [github.iamnoah.com](http://github.iamnoah.com). Feel free to browse the source, fork, [ask me questions](http://twitter.com/noahj32), and post your own compelling blog posts. Because sharing is caring. We're developers, after all.

Forked from [holman's](http://github.com/holman) blog with love and care.
