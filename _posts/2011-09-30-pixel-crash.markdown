After the staggering mediocrity of my [first few renders][1], I immediately made
elaborate plans to create my next video. And here it is, five months of
110-hour weeks later. Well, maybe I mostly spent those five months putting it
off. But you can imagine what it'd look like if I spent 110-hour weeks on it!
It would have been magical!

Instead, I bring you this one.

## P I X E L  C R A S H

This stemmed from wanting to experiment with the [voxel plugin][2] from Robert
Leger over at robertleger.net (go check out his blog, great stuff). Lathered
heavily with inspiration from the [Pixels video][6] by Patrick Jean.
