# Round the World (RTW) Trip
The Round the World trip blog entries are a collection of <a href='http://github.com/magus/shell-scripts/blob/master/create-blog-markdown.zsh'
target='_blank'>automagically generated</a>
blog entries based on my trip around the world. During my travels I periodically
update simple text files for each location, with my experiences, thoughts and the
people that I meet. The content is very stream of thought; entries are written in
short, ocassionally incomplete, sentences. Enjoy!
